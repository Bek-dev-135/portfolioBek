                      <p>I have worked on a personal project as a part of my course to make this web scrapper <a href="https://github.com/Bek-dev-135/Learning-Pythn.git">(link to github)</a>
                      For now, it is set to fetch all the news on the Hacker News website and collect all items that have a vote greater than 500, demonstrating how we can work around the API for better data usage and get exactly the information we want. Also, another work I did with Twitter's API was a bot that could be modeled to fetch different types of data about our account; it could be the number of followers we have (we can put it in a list and use it for marketing), searching for specific hashtags in our tweets, and a lot more. You can also find this bot's code in the repository <a href="https://github.com/Bek-dev-135/Learning-Pythn.git">(link to github)</a> /ztmtwitter.

                        <p>
                        This python code fetches all compromised passwords from the well-known hackaton webpage, but since we don't want to put our actual password on there and search it with the risk of sending our password to them, what we could do is give a little portion of the hash version of our password, and when the website gives us a list of passwords that match those first few strings, we scrape that list to our device and try to match the rest of our passwords from what's on that list. Now we can rest assured that we didn't give our full password to an unknown website, and we can calculate from the data that it gives us based on the bits of password we offered. The code for this could be found here <a href="https://github.com/Bek-dev-135/Learning-Pythn.git">(link to github)</a> file name passwordchecker.py

                        <p> I will share below one of many tools we have worked on to automate and save the time of the assistant service line. This automation tool for Outlook fetches all the available free slots in our calendar. I created this tool to share availabilities faster among people who work with scheduling a lot of meetings. It dynamically adjusts to time zones and meeting times. The making of this tool was followed by a testing phase where I learned how feedback significantly helps eliminate issues for the end user. I hope that this tool will be used by a large number of people to streamline the process of scheduling meetings.</p>
